RTDC Pilot Project [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Bathlamos/RTDC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Bathlamos/RTDC)
==================

Long wait times to receive care in hospitals is one of the major issue plaguing the healthcare system. A new approach to manage the patient flow in terms of hours and not days is called Real-Time Demand Capacity Management (RTDC).  RTDC normally evaluates the capacity at 2pm, after most of the patients have been discharged for the day and before most of the new patients are admitted.

The RTDC Pilot Project is a cross-platform application that implements the RTDC methodology, for use in a pilot project at the Queensway Carleton Hospital. 

Pr. Daniel Amyot is the Capstone Project supervisor. Mr. Alain Mouttham, founder of the start-up HealthNow, will be the client. Other partnerships include the following.
*	OpenFace, HealthNow. 
*	The University of Ottawa (the application is part of a research project)

Platform support is 
* Android > Ice Cream Sandwhich (4+)
* iOS > 8 for iPad and iPad mini 
* Internet Explorer 9
